# What it does? 
It tracks the CO2 emission you save by using a bicycle instead of another vehicle that emissions CO2. 

You get points for every gram of co2 you save by cycling and these points can be used to challenge friends, followers and cities.
 
People can also exchange these points for rewards such as discounts on green or school products.
